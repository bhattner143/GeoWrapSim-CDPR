## Installation

To set up the repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhattner143/GeoWrapSim-CDPR.git
    ```

2. **Add the folder to MATLAB**:
    Open MATLAB, navigate to the downloaded folder, and add it to the MATLAB path.

3. **Initialize the CASPR environment**:
    Run the `initialise_CASPR.m` script to configure the Cable-Driven Parallel Robot Simulator (CASPR) environment.

### About CASPR
CASPR is a simulation framework designed for modeling and analyzing cable-driven parallel robots. It provides tools for kinematic and dynamic analysis, enabling researchers and engineers to study complex cable-driven systems effectively.
